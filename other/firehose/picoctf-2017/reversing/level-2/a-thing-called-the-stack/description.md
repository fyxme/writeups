A Thing Called the Stack
A friend was stacking dinner plates, and handed you this, saying something about a "stack". Can you find the difference between the value of esp at the end of the code, and the location of the saved return address? Assume a 32 bit system. Submit the answer as a hexidecimal number, with no extraneous 0s. For example, the decimal number 2015 would be submitted as 0x7df, not 0x000007df
