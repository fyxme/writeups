This is a pcap file therefore we open it with wireshark to analyse the traffic.

We filter by http and realise there is only 1 POST request.

We explore that packet and realise there is a password parameter with value: `UldPRVRNOWZhWQ==`

This seems like base64 encoding.

Decoding it gives us "RWOETM9faY" which is the flag for the challenge.

Flag: `RWOETM9faY`
