By running ls we can see that the source code is include in the folder.

Looking at the source code, we see that the file uses relative path to get the auth file.
We can therefore create a fake auth file and spoof that path by running it from a different location.

We create the folder `/tmp/problems/fcf3cfa90b13f6ed463d61aa9b4da4ce` and cd into it.

We create a file named `auth` and add the text "yes" to it.
`echo yes > auth`

We then run the program from this directory. 
`/problems/fcf3cfa90b13f6ed463d61aa9b4da4ce/justno`

The program uses our newly created flag file and we get access to the flag.

Flag: `23ef992262f66c836ca999a82c17e0e3`
