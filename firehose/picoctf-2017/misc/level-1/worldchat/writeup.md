Worldchat is an overwhelming amount of text being thrown at you.

By grepping for "flag" we see messages which output parts of the flag

We can further improve our grep to only map parts of the flag by grepping for "of the flag".

This gives out all the parts requires to build our flag.

Flag: `7c2077dc26c16dc81acde49cd5630146`
