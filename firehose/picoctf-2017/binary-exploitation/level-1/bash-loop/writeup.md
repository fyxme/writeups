The number does not seem to change so we can use python to create a simple script to bruteforce the correct value.

The script is :
```python

import os

for i in range(0,4096):
    os.system('./bashloop {}'.format(i))

```

We run it from the bashloop directory as follows:
`python script.py > out.txt` - we redirect the output to out.txt so we can grep it for the flag

Lastly we grep the out.txt file for the flag:
`cat out.txt | grep flag`

Flag: `d3aaad36e3947ceed96a916ca92d33b4`
