As the title suggest this seems to be a monoalphabetic substitution challenge.

Using `https://quipqiup.com/` which uses statistical analysis get a mostly decoded cipher which can be seen in the `plain.txt` file.

The first line is `THE FLAG IS IFONLYMODERNCRYPTO?ASLI?ETHIS.`

quipquip didn't manage to convert all the letters but we can easily understand the meaning and input the missing letters.

Flag: `IFONLYMODERNCRYPTOWASLIKETHIS`
