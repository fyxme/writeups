Ancient cipher
BY ANDREIGASPAROVICI

My friend showed me a message encrypted with an ancient cipher:
ILYWOYFNYRPOASESOCTSA
Can you help me decrypt it?
(To get the flag, put the lowercase decrypted message inside flag{...})

P.S. He was talking about a fence. I don't know what he meant, but you may find this useful.
