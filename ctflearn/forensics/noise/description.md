Hey! I have intercepted this https://mega.nz/#!WXgSVQQZ!5FSM07uGn0Lnu3Vrhc99kaXrxp6N8QBuh8avmMVgQFk from the Center for Interesting Arrangements.
 Out of all the documents the CIA holds, this seems to stand out because I don't see any "interesting arrangement" in this image. Pretty sure that this is just a bunch of noise... or is it? Look at this file closely and you'll (definitely) agree with me!
