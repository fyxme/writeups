> Crpyto can often be done by hand, here's a message you got from a friend, llkjmlmpadkkc with the key of thisisalilkey. Can you use this table to solve it?.

The table is already a good hint that this cipher is a vignere cipher.

Using vignere cipher decoding tools we get the message:
`secretmessage`

we add the flag template to get the flag : `picoCTF{secretmessage}`

Unfortunately this is the wrong flag but by looking at the hints we see that the flag should be in all caps (`Please use all caps for the message.`)

Flag: `picoCTF{SECRETMESSAGE}`
