# CTF & Wargames - writeups and exploits

This repo contains a few of the ctf and wargames I've participated in. The repo is currently a mess and needs to be cleaned up. Some challenges have the exploits and not the writeup and other have the writeup but no exploit script.

Either way, this is a work in progress.

Some example writeups:
- [binary exploitation](comp6447-binary-exploitation/4/3/writeup.md)
- [websec](overthewire/natas.md)

If you are interested in reading writeups look under `/comp6447-binary-exploitation` since folder is pretty well kept.
